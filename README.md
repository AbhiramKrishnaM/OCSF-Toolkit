# OCSF POC - Integrated Platform

An interactive web platform demonstrating the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) through four integrated tools: schema visualization, data mapping, event generation, and real-time security monitoring. Built with React, TypeScript, and React Flow to showcase OCSF's capabilities in cybersecurity data standardization and analysis.
